# Intro to Activities
When I first started my journey into the world of programming, I often felt lost and confused by the large amount of theory presented without enough practice. I didn’t really know what to do or where to go. Fortunately, I came across a quote by **Anton Chekhov** that changed my perspective:

> *Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.*

That idea made me realize that **practice is the key to truly learning anything.** We don’t learn how to drive by reading a book—we learn by actually driving.

That’s why I decided to group together various activities and exercises, with the goal of turning theory into muscle memory through practice.

In this section, you’ll find multiple exercises designed to help you learn a specific programming language. Each activity includes its own solution, explained step by step, so you can compare your approach and learn from it.

I hope this section helps you get hands-on with code, build real understanding, and find the right path forward in the world of technology.
