# SQL Normalization Activities - Leveling Up
> This activity was made by [Robinson Andres Cortes](https://github.com/andrescortesdev/)

Database normalization is a database schema design technique used to reduce data redundancy and eliminate undesirable dependencies by organizing data into well-structured tables.

The purpose of this activity is to improve and normalize a database schema by applying database normalization principles using a visual design tool. For this activity, you will use **MySQL Workbench**, a visual database design and modeling tool.

If you do not have MySQL Workbench installed, you can download it from the following link:  
[MySQL Community Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

Also you must use the **Entity Relationship Diagram** (ERD) concepts in the schema.

For more information about **normalization** please click [here](https://www.w3schools.in/dbms/database-normalization).\
For more information about **ERD** please click in this videos: [Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Tutorial - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsg9BDiwiJE) and [Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Tutorial - Part 2: Primary keys, foreign keys, and bridge tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hktyW5Lp0Vo)

### Instructions
1. Download the provided **Excel file**, which contains the initial database structure.
2. Analyze the data and identify redundancies and dependencies.
3. Recreate and normalize the database schema using **MySQL Workbench** and apply **ERD** concepts.
4. Apply the appropriate normalization rules (e.g., 1NF, 2NF, 3NF).
5. Once finished, compare your normalized schema with the provided solution to verify correctness.

### Expected Outcome
By completing this activity, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of database normalization
- Design cleaner and more efficient database schemas
- Use MySQL Workbench for visual database modeling


## Level 1
Please download the **Excel file** by clicking [here](../../assets/sql-normalization/table-1.xlsx).\
Remember **normalize** the database applying **ERD** concepts.
