# My Projects
One of the best things when you're a coder is to take care of all your projects, I really think that my projects are the bonestone of my coding learning journey. And they're like the foodprints that you leave when your walking thought.

I want to share all my project that I have done since the first day I started, just to let the beginners know that is not imposible to achive those goals, the journey is long and hard, but and at the end, when you see your progress and all the things that you have done, you would be excited and focus.
